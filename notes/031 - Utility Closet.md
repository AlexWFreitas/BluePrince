This room allows you to control many things related to energy through a breaker box.

## Recommended Breaker Box Setup
- Turn Keycard Entry System Off if you found the [[Security Room]]
- Turn Gymnasium Off to disable penalty from Gymnasium
- Turn Dark Room On to be able to see what's inside and maybe disable the penalty (?)
- Turn Garage On to enable electricity on Garage Room
- Turn VAC Indicators on the Correct Pattern to open hidden room
	- Turn everything into green
	- This allows you to turn things into blue
	- If you turn the dot beside the blue dot into something, it will turn purple
	- You can turn 5 dots into purple and then turn the final one into purple by clicking it
	- After that you are able to turn any of the dots into white
	- Then you need to set the correct pattern to open the hidden room switch
		- **Off - Blue - Green - White - Red - Purple**
