There is a theme of distance between feet on this room drawings.

Like there is a gap between two feets and this is represented by a line with arrows.

One of the candlelights can be pulled to reveal a [[Drawing Room Safe]]

One of the theories for the Safe Code is to count the number of pictures that are the same and interpret that as the number and the distance between feet as the order.


It seems there are four distances

Small Step - Old Man + Woman
Middle Step - Gentlemen
Large Jump - Kid
Largest Step - Horse

Based on the picture count it seems that they go above 10, so maybe the direction they are facing means negative or positive.

Woman - -2 +2
Old Man -  -11 + 4
Gentleman -  -4 +7
Kid - -1 +4
Horse - -3 +3
