## Gameplay
- Moving into a room uses a step
- You can throw coins into the water fountain outside of the house, bonus unknown
- You can get multiple bonuses from the Observatory in a single day, because more than one star sign can appear, so it's important to always visit the Observatory to start stacking the star points.
