### Possible Clues
- Need to figure out how the Room Rank System works, because it doesn't make much sense to me.
	- I need to write the ranks on each of the rooms, so that I can discover if the rank changes based on room depth.
	- Also I need to figure if the room rank influences the available rooms on the doors inside.
